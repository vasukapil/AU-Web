    <h1>Corporate Tax</h1>

    <p>A corporate tax is a levy on a company's profit by the government. The money collected in the form of corporate
        taxes is used as a country's source of income. A company's operating income is calculated by deducting expenses,
        including the cost of goods sold or services procured and depreciation from revenues. Next, applicable tax rates
        are applied to create a legal obligation that the company owes the government.</p>

    <p>Corporate tax is levied on the companies, whether domestic or foreign. In India, the Income Tax Act, 1961 governs
        the provisions of charging corporate tax to companies. Global income of the companies registered in our country
        is covered for taxation under this. Whereas in the case of foreign companies, only the income received or accrued
        in India is taxable under the corporate tax. AU is leading corporate tax experts in Delhi.</p>

    <h2>What is a domestic company?</h2>

    <p>Any company whose business is originated in India or any foreign company whose effective management and control
        are entirely situated in India is the domestic company. The companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956 or
        Companies Act, 2013 are said to be originated in India.</p>

    <h2>What is a foreign company?</h2>

    <p>Any company that has not originated in India and whose effective control & management is situated outside India.</p>

    <h2>Helping Companies reduce Taxable Income</h2>

        tax authorities are often challenged to meet continually changing conditions.</p>
