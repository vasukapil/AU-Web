# Corporate Tax

A corporate tax is a levy on a company's profit by the government. The money collected in the form of corporate taxes is used as a country's source of income. A company's operating income is calculated by deducting expenses, including the cost of goods sold or services procured and depreciation from revenues. Next, applicable tax rates are applied to create a legal obligation that the company owes the government.

Corporate tax is levied on the companies, whether domestic or foreign. In India, the Income Tax Act, 1961 governs the provisions of charging corporate tax to companies. Global income of the companies registered in our country is covered for taxation under this. Whereas in the case of foreign companies, only the income received or accrued in India is taxable under the corporate tax. AU is leading corporate tax experts in Delhi.

## What is a domestic company?

Any company whose business is originated in India or any foreign company whose effective management and control are entirely situated in India is the domestic company. The companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956 or Companies Act, 2013 are said to be originated in India.

## What is a foreign company?

Any company that has not originated in India and whose effective control & management is situated outside India.

## Direct & Indirect Tax - Overview

Taxation – An Overview

In India, our tax structure is divided into two parts: Direct Tax and Indirect Tax. It is very crucial to understand the overview of Direct and Indirect Tax. While direct taxes are levied on incomes earned by individuals and corporate entities, the burden to pay taxes is on the taxpayers themselves. On the other hand, indirect taxes are imposed on the sale of goods and provision of services where the burden to collect and deposit taxes is on the sellers instead of the taxpayer directly. However, indirect taxes are borne by the ultimate consumers of goods or services.

Central Governments and State Governments levy significant Taxes in our country. However, Local Authorities such as Municipality and Local governments have also been given some powers for levy and collection of taxes and charges in their jurisdictions.

Over the last few years, the Central and many State Governments have undertaken many reforms in policy formulation and implementations for the objective of Ease of doing business and regular efforts on simplification of processes towards great predictability, transparency and automation. Introduction of GST is one of such reforms to eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and to overcome the complexities in multiple indirect tax regimes in India.

Yet both the size and shape of taxation vary significantly across countries and have been transformed over time.

    title: 'Income Tax Return Filings',
    markdownText: `## Income Tax Return Filings - An Overview

    Income Tax Return services and income tax consultants in Delhi. An Income Tax Return is a form in which a person files information on their income earned during a financial year and the corresponding tax payable to the Income Tax Department. Under Income Tax, a person can be an individual, HUF, Firm or LLP, company, NGO, Society, Trust, etc. The government has made it mandatory for individuals and others who earn a specified amount of annual income to file their ITRs within the due dates prescribed under the act. Those who earn less than the amount chargeable to tax can also submit their returns voluntarily.
    
    A lot of individuals think filing of income tax return an unnecessary and voluntary task and thereby wholly ignore the benefits associated with filing tax returns. Filing of returns is not at all a burdensome process; instead, it is effortless and beneficial. As a responsible citizen of the country, it is your social and moral duty as well to file income tax returns annually.
    
    We at AU help you in calculating your correct income tax payable or refundable, provide the best consultancy in reducing your tax liabilities, and significant tax reliefs which may get ignored by individuals if a professional is not hired. Our team of experts can assist in income tax return filing in Delhi so that returns can be filed on time. Our team can approach you as we are located in Barakhamba Road, Connaught Place.
    
    Reasons why to File Income Tax Returns by Individual taxpayers?
    
    There are a lot of reasons as to the filing of returns by the taxpayers. Some significant benefits that accrue to individual taxpayers in filing IT returns are:
    
    1. Getting Loans and Credit Cards approved
       - For getting various loans like Housing Loans, Vehicle Loans, Business, personal loans, and credit card approvals, a copy of ITR is a mandatory part without which you can face hurdles in getting such loans approved smoothly.
    
    2. Quick Visa Approvals
       - For visa approvals, it is mandatorily required by the Immigration department to produce proof of Income tax returns along with scrutiny of other essential documents.
    
    3. To Claim Income Tax Refunds and Business Losses
       - Any income tax-related refunds and losses in the business can only be claimed from the IT department when a taxpayer duly files a return. It is equally required to carry forward the previous year losses as well.
    
    4. Avoiding Penalties and Prosecution
       - There are punitive provisions in the income tax act in the form of fines, penalties, and prosecution if a taxpayer fails to file the return of income when he is required to file as per the law. It is advisable to file these returns either on your own or by hiring someone like income tax consultants who can do this for you. If you are searching for a CA for income tax filing in Delhi or a tax consultant Delhi, you can reach out to us as we are one of the best tax firms in Delhi, and we aim to serve our clients with the most satisfactory services.
    
    ITR Filing of HUF
    
    Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is treated as a separate entity for assessment under the Income Tax Act. HUF does not originate from a contract. HUF is in itself a creation of law. After marriage, as soon as a child is born, HUF comes into existence. HUF consists of Father, sons, and daughters. The wife is not part of the HUF. Sons, daughters, and the father, i.e., Karta, are the co-parceners in the joint family and have the right to command partition. The Karta can deliver his share in the co-parcenary to his wife.
    
    If courts make the partition of HUF, the courts will always award an equal partition. However, the family can mutually give effect to the partition without moving to the courts, and that can be unequal as per their agreement.
    
    The provisions of computing income of the HUF are the same as for a normal person. AU, one of the best taxation firms in Delhi, can help you in forming HUF as well as in filing the income tax return.
    
    ITR Filing of Partnership Firms
    
    More than one person forms a partnership firm for conducting business under one entity. There are two types of firms (other than LLPs)-
     
    - Registered partnership firm
    - Unregistered partnership firm
     
    A registered firm is a firm that has been registered with the Registrar of Firms and has obtained a registration certificate. Any partnership firm that does not have a registration certificate from the Registrar of Firms is unregistered. Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, a partnership firm and LLPs are liable to pay tax at a flat rate of 30%, increased by 12% surcharge if taxable income exceeds 1 crore, followed by 4% health and education cess.
     
    A partnership firm is a distinct legal entity from its partners, unlike sole proprietorships. It is also essential to pay income tax for a partnership firm, irrespective of whether the firm is registered or not. Just like LLPs and private limited companies, a partnership firm is also required to pay alternate minimum tax as per the applicable rates. To file tax returns for a partnership firm, one must submit the Form ITR-5. The form ITR-5 is used to file tax returns of the partnership firm only. There is a separate form available for the individual tax filing of partners of the firm. Similar to all other income tax return filings, ITR-5 can be submitted online via the income tax department’s online portal.
     
    Our team of professional experts assists you in filing income tax returns and guides you on all compliances applicable to a partnership firm. We are one of the best Tax Consultants in Delhi serving partnership firms in filing their return of income.
    
    ITR Filing of NGO/Trust/Society
    
    Trusts have a unique tax mechanism. In the case of an assessee who is engaged in business, usually, all expenditures incurred are permissible as deductions as it relates to the earning of income. The same is not the case for trusts. In the case of a trust, there is no nexus between the income (i.e., receipts by way of donations, grants, etc.) and expenses (application of money). As a result, the gross revenue of the trust is liable for tax irrespective of the amount expended towards its charitable cause. For becoming eligible for availing deduction towards the amount applied for a charitable purpose, the trust must get registration u/s 12A of the Income Tax Act-1961.
     
    The registration is a one-time procedure. After registering, the trust can claim exemptions provided under the income tax. Trusts and NGOs registered under section 12A can exercise waiver from paying income tax on their receipts. The amount collected will be free from taxes as the fund used for charitable or religious purposes is deemed to be the application of income. The "application of income" refers to the expenditure towards charitable or religious purposes when computing the income for taxation.
     
    The person registered under this section gets the benefit of setting apart 15% of the receipts for which no restrictions prevail for its application under the act. Such accumulated amount is granted as an application of income u/s section 11(2) & does not form part of the total income of a trust. Also, once the registration is granted, it lasts until it is canceled by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption) for any valid reasons. There are no requirements for renewing the registration. Charitable Trusts, Religious Trusts, NGOs registered under the Societies Act and section 8 companies are eligible to apply for 12A registration.
     
    AU, being one of the best Taxation Firms in Delhi, can help you in forming NGOs, Trusts, and Societies. We can also help in applying for 12A registration and provide assistance in filing tax returns for NGOs, Trusts, and Societies. Our team of expert professionals ensures that all compliances are duly met, and the tax returns are filed accurately.
    
    Conclusion
    
    Filing income tax returns is a crucial responsibility for individuals, HUFs, firms, companies, NGOs, societies, and trusts. It not only helps in availing various financial benefits like loans and credit cards but also prevents penalties and prosecution. By hiring professional tax consultants like AU, you can ensure that your tax returns are filed accurately and on time, maximizing your tax benefits and minimizing your tax liabilities.

## Lower Deduction Certificate

Given the tendency of taxpayers to evade taxes, Income Tax provisions provide for the collection of tax from the very source of income. Under this system, the person liable to make the payment (payer) is responsible for deducting tax before making the payment to the recipient at the rates specified by the revenue department.

Such tax has to be deducted either at the time of crediting the amount in the books or when making payment to tthe recipient, whichever is earlier. It ensures the timely collection of revenues by the government and controls tax evasion.
- Concept of Lower Deduction of Tax
- In some situations, the TDS amount might be higher than the recipient's actual tax liability. This is very common in the case of the sale of immovable property of NRI, wherein TDS at the rate of 20% gets deducted on the entire sale value instead of being deducted on the amount of capital gains value only.

In such a scenario, the assessees have to face difficulties as they have to pay tax in the form of TDS despite not having any earnings liable to tax for the year, which they can claim as a refund only by filing their return of income.

This situation leads to unnecessary blockage of funds until the refund is received. Furthermore, assessees have to comply with filing their Income Tax return to claim it even if they are otherwise not required to do so on account of their total income being lower than the basic exemption limit that applies to them.

Therefore, to eliminate this unnecessary load on such assessees, the Income Tax Act provides the option to obtain a certificate, known as Lower Deduction Certificate (LDC) from the Assessing Officer under the provisions of Section 197, allowing the deduction of tax either at a lower rate compared to the effective rate or at NIL rate of TDS, depending on facts and features of each case based on the application made.

- Situations in which it is beneficial to get the LDC issued
  - Loss-making businesses
  - Assessee having carried forward losses to set off with future year’s income
  - Assessee having net total income below the applicable basic exemption limit
  - Receipt of the payment for the sale of property in India by a non-resident seller from an Indian buyer
  - Receipt of the payment by a company that does not have Permanent Establishment in India from the customer who is liable to deduct tax at source under section 195

This list, as mentioned above, is not exhaustive and there might be other cases also where LDC issuance would be beneficial.

- Prescribed Form for LDC Application
  - Application for a lower deduction certificate under section 197 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, for no tax deduction or tax deduction at a lower rate, must be made in Form 13 online.

- Details/Documents to be submitted and how to apply for Lower Deduction Certificate
  - The documents and details that are required to be submitted with Form 13 online application are:
    - Mobile number of the applicant
    - E-mail ID of the applicant
    - Copy of PAN card
    - Tax Deduction Account Number of all the parties responsible for making the payment
    - Copies of return of income and computation of income of previous three financial years
    - Copies of Form 26AS of previous three financial years
    - In case of the assessee having business or professional income, copies of financial statement along with audit report if any for previous three financial years
    - Projected profit and loss account for the ongoing financial year
    - Estimated income during the financial year
    - Any other document depending on the nature of the income

Once the application has been filed successfully, the assessing officer will review the documents/information submitted and might ask for further queries and documents before issuing the certificate/rejecting the application.

On being satisfied that the lower deduction of TDS is justified, he shall issue the certificate u/s 197.

On successful allotment of the lower deduction certificate, the tax will be deducted at the rate stated therein. The Lower Deduction Certificate will be issued online, and the applicant can download it from the Traces portal.
- Eligibility for Making an Application for the LDC
  - The application can be made where the particular income of any person attracts TDS as per the relevant sections concerned with tax deduction at source and estimated total income of the recipient justifies no deduction or lower deduction of Income Tax for the relevant financial year.

- Time Limit for Making LDC Application
  - The Income Tax Act specifies no time limit for applying for the lower deduction certificate. However, as TDS applies to income of the ongoing financial year, it is recommended to make the application at the beginning of the financial year in case of regular income throughout the year and as and when it is required in case of one-off incomes.

- Lower Deduction Certificate Validity
  - A lower deduction certificate is granted for a specific financial year. Its validity period is from the date of its issuance until the end of such financial year unless revoked by the assessing officer before its expiry.

- Advantages of obtaining LDC
  - The option of applying for a lower deduction certificate proves to be beneficial for an assessee because of the following reasons:
    - It prevents needless blockage of funds in the form of TDS.
    - There is no need to file the income tax return if tax has been deducted at NIL rate (i.e., no tax has been deducted) and if the assessee is not liable to file the return according to his total income for the financial year.
    - In the case of an NRI selling immovable property in India, such NRI does not have to bother about any future scrutiny notices to a possible extent if he makes the application for issuance of a lower deduction certificate as he has already undergone pre-assessment of capital gains amount while getting the LDC issued.

- How AU can help?
  - Providing a nil or lower rate for tax deduction helps strike a balance between the need to ensure cash flow to the taxpayer and receiving government dues at the earliest. If the assessee does not obtain this certificate, he will have to apply for a refund of the excess tax deducted by filing the Income Tax return at the end of the year. Hence, he should avail the benefit of this option to avoid blockage of funds and the hassle of filing the ITR to claim the refund, if any.
  
  However, if the procedure of getting the lower deduction certificate issued seems complicated to you and if you are confused on how to apply Form 13, we, at AU will be happy to help you out. We are the best lower deduction certificate service provider. We have a team of LDC experts in Delhi who will assist you in matters related to making Form 13 online application, issuance of lower deduction certificate for NRIs and fulfilment of other procedural compliances while getting the Lower Deduction Certificate issued.

    title: 'TDS and TCS Return Filings',
    markdownText: `
    - TDS and TCS Return Filings
- TCS and TDS are two of the most commonly used words when we talk about taxation. In the field of tax, TDS stands for Tax Deducted at Source while TCS stands for Tax Collected at Source. When they sound almost identical, you must be wondering how they actually differ. Also, when the Government works on a self-assessment model of tax, why do TDS and TCS come into play?

In this content, we have tried putting light on some of the important aspects of TDS and TCS. So, let us walk through the same to answer the above questions.

- TDS
- What is TDS?
- For a speedy and efficient collection of taxes, the Income Tax Law has integrated a system of deduction of tax at the time of generation of income. This system is known as "Tax Deducted at Source", generally called TDS. Under this mechanism, tax is deducted at the point of origination of income. The payer deducts tax, and the same is directly remitted to the Government by the payer on behalf of the payee. The concept of TDS was introduced to combat and reduce tax evasion.

The provisions of tax deducted at source currently apply to several payments like salary, interest, commission, brokerage, professional fees, royalty, etc. The recipients of such income can claim an Income Tax TDS refund of the excess tax paid by them in the form of TDS at the time of filing their ITR if their tax deducted is more than the required amount.

- What is the due date for a tax deductor to deposit TDS to the Government?
- Tax deducted at source has to be deposited to the credit of the Central Government within the following due dates:

  a) In case the amount is credited or paid in the month of March - On or before 30th April following the month in which the deduction is made (i.e., March).

  b) In any other case - Within seven days from the end of the month in which the deduction is made.

  For example: If a person deducts tax at source in June 2022, then he will have to deposit such amount of tax to the Government on or before 7th July 2022.

  However, in case the tax has been deducted under the following sections, then it has to be deposited to the Government within a period of 30 days from the end of the month in which the deduction is made:

  a. Section 194-IA: TDS on payment on transfer of immovable property other than agricultural land.

  b. Section 194-IB: TDS on payment of rent by certain individuals or Hindu undivided family (other than those covered u/s 194I).

  c. Section 194M: TDS on payment for a contract, payment of commission or brokerage or fees for technical services by certain individuals or Hindu undivided family (other than those covered u/s 194C, 194H or 194J).

- What if the due date to deduct tax or deposit the TDS to the Government is missed?
- According to section 201 of the Income Tax Act, if a deductor fails to deduct tax at source or after deducting the same fails to deposit it to the Government, then he/she shall be considered to be an assessee-in-default and liable to pay simple interest at the following rates:

  a) at 1% for every month or part of a month on the amount of such tax from the date on which it was supposed to be deducted to the date on which it is actually deducted; and

  b) at 1.5% for every month or part of a month on the amount of such tax from the date it was deducted to the date on which it is actually paid to the Government.

- TCS
- What is TCS?
- The tax collected at source, abbreviated as TCS, is another means of collecting tax at the very source of income by the Government. Under the TCS provisions, certain specified transactions require the seller to collect an additional amount as tax at the time of sale over and above the sale price and remit the same to the Central Government.

As per the TCS provisions of the Income Tax Act 1961, certain persons, being the sellers, must collect a specified percentage of tax at the time of debiting the amount payable by the purchaser to the account of the purchaser or at the time of receipt of the amount from the purchaser, whichever is earlier.

The person collecting tax has to obtain a Tax Collection Account Number and quote it in all challans, certificates and returns, and other documents pertaining to the transactions.

- What is the due date for a tax collector to deposit TCS to the Government?
- The tax collected at source has to be deposited to the credit of the Central Government within seven days from the last day of the month in which the tax is collected.

  For example: If a seller collects tax from a buyer in May 2022, then he will have to deposit such tax to the Government on or before 7th June 2022.

- What if the due date to collect the tax or deposit the TCS to the Government is missed?
- According to section 206C(7), if the person liable to collect tax at source fails to collect it or after collecting defaults in paying it to the Government, he shall be required to pay simple interest at 1% per month or part of the month on the amount of such tax from the date it was supposed to be collected to the date on which the tax was actually paid to the Government, and such interest shall be deposited before furnishing the TCS statement for each quarter.

Types of TDS&TCS Return Form | Meaning
--- | ---
Form 24Q | Statement of deduction of tax at source from salary under section 192.
Form 26Q | Statement of deduction of tax at source on all payments other than salaries.
Form 27Q | Statement of deduction of tax on payment of interest, dividends, or any other sum payable to non-residents.
Form 26QB | Challan-cum-statement in case tax has been deducted under section 194-IA. In this case, no statement shall be filed separately.
Form 26QC | Challan-cum-statement in case tax has been deducted under section 194-IB. In this case, no statement shall be filed separately.
Form 26QD | Challan-cum-statement in case tax has been deducted under section 194-M. In this case, no statement shall be filed separately.
Form 27EQ | Statement of collection of tax at source to be filed quarterly with the Government.
Form 27D | Statement of collection of tax at source issued to the buyer by the tax collector to the effect that tax has been collected.

Types of TDS/TCS Return Forms
- The tax deductor and tax collector are liable to deduct/collect tax, pay challan and file the TDS/TCS returns. There are various types of TCS and TDS Return Forms applicable for different scenarios based on the type of the transaction and the parties involved in such a transaction. Below is the list of different types of TDS and TCS return filing forms:

    markdownText: `
    - TDS and TCS Return Filing Due Dates
    - During the year, the tax deductor and tax collector have to furnish the returns on a quarterly basis containing the particulars of tax deducted or collected, as the case may be, during the respective period. The due dates for TCS and TDS quarterly return filing are as follows:
    
    Quarter | Period Covered | TDS Return filing Due Date | TCS Return filing Due Date
    --- | --- | --- | ---
    1st Quarter | 1st April to 30th June | 31st July | 15th July
    2nd Quarter | 1st July to 30th September | 31st October | 15th October
    3rd Quarter | 1st October to 31st December | 31st January | 15th January
    4th Quarter | 1st January to 31st March | 31st May | 15th May
    
    Let us consider the following examples to understand the due dates for TDS and TCS return filing better:
    
    1) Suppose Mr. Verma deducts tax on payment of commission u/s 194H on 25th September, 2022. In this case, the last TDS return filing date applicable to Mr. Verma would be 31st October, 2022. Hence, he will have to file TDS return Form 26Q on or before 31st October, 2022. Otherwise, he will become liable to pay the late TDS return filing penalty (discussed below) to the Government.
    
    2) Suppose Mr. Singh collects tax on receipt of payment on the sale of scrap u/s 206C on 16th May, 2022. In this case, the last date of TCS return filing would be 15th July, 2022. Hence, Mr. Singh will have to file TCS return form 27EQ on or before 15th July, 2022. Otherwise, he will be required to pay the penalty (discussed below) to the Government for missing the TCS return due date.
    
    - E-TCS and E-TDS Return Filing
    - As per Section 206 of the Income Tax Act, all corporate and government deductors are compulsorily required to file their NSDL TDS returns electronically (e-TDS returns). However, for other deductors, TDS e return filing is optional. Hence, the other deductors have an option to go for TDS return filing online (i.e., TDS e-filing) or file it in physical form.
    
    Similarly, in the case of TCS also, it is mandatory for corporate and government collectors to file their TCS returns in electronic form (e-TCS return). However, for other collectors (collectors other than Government and corporates), online TCS return filing is not mandatory, and they have an option to file it electronically or in physical mode.
    
    One can file TDS and TCS returns online using a TDS TCS return filing software also.
    
    - Penalty for Late Filing of TCS Return and TDS Return
    - Every person liable to fulfill the TDS return filing process or TCS return filing procedure must comply with all the provisions of TDS and TCS quarterly return filing because if he fails in furnishing the TDS TCS returns, he shall be required to pay a penalty of a sum of two hundred rupees for every day during which the default continues.
    
    However, such a fee cannot exceed the amount of TDS or TCS, as the case may be, for which the return is being furnished.
    
    So, the taxpayers must make sure that they comply with all the provisions of TCS and TDS filing, like furnishing Form 26Q TDS or Form 27Q TDS or Form 27EQ before the applicable TDS and TCS return last dates to avoid any TCS/TDS late return filing penalty.
    
    If you are wondering how to file a TDS return online on the new Income Tax website or check TDS return filing status, or if you want to know more about TDS return filing or TDS return filing utility, or TCS on the sale of goods return filing, you can feel free to contact us at partner@theaucorp.com.

    ## Introduction of GST
    
    Amidst economic crisis across the globe, India has feigned a signal of strength with aggressive growth targets, supported by a bunch of strategic moves like Digital India and Make in India initiatives. Bringing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) into picture is another such move that is expected to give the much-needed momentum for economic growth in India by transforming the existing indirect taxation towards the seamless flow of goods and services tax. GST is introduced to eliminate the cascading effect of taxes. India can play an essential role in the world economy in the years to come. The expectation with GST reforms is very high not only within the country but also within neighbouring countries and developed economies of the world.
    
    GST is a consolidation of a myriad of different indirect taxes levied by the Centre and state government into a universal tax. The GST has eradicated the complexities involved with charging various taxes. GST came into existence from 1st July 2017 with the objective of “One Nation One Tax” which needs businesses to file monthly quarterly and annual returns. The registered persons with a yearly turnover of more than two crores are also required to file an audit report.
    
    ## Benefits of GST
    
    - Subsumed bunch of indirect taxes such as VAT, CST, Service tax, CAD, SAD, and Excise
    - Lesser tax compliances and a simplified tax policy compared to the previous tax regime
    - Elimination of the cascading effect of taxes, i.e. removal of tax on tax
    - Reduction of manufacturing costs due to less burden of taxes on the manufacturers, thereby fall in prices of consumer goods.
    - Lowering the tax burden on the common man, i.e. public will have to spend less money to obtain the same products that were expensive earlier.
    - Increase in demand and consumption of goods
    - Increased demand will lead to an increase in supply. Hence, this will ultimately lead to a rise in the production of goods.
    - Control of bogus transactions through a more transparent mechanism under new regime to curb black money circulation typically followed by traders and shopkeepers
    - Boosting and advancing of the Indian economy in the long run
    
    These benefits are possible only if the exact benefit of GST is passed on to the ultimate consumer. There are numerous other factors too, such as seller’s profit markup, that determines the final price of goods. GST alone does not conclude the final price of goods.
    
    ## Impact of GST on Indian Economy
    
    - Decreases tax burden on producers and fosters growth through increased productions. The existing taxation structure, drawn with multiple tax clauses, prevents manufacturers from producing to their optimum capacity and impedes growth. GST will solve these difficulties by allowing tax credits to the producers.
    - Several tax restrictions, like toll plazas and check posts, lead to wastage of unpreserved things being transported. This penalty converts into high costs due to the higher needs of buffer stock and warehousing costs. A single and easy taxation system will excrete this roadblock.
    - The system will be more transparent now that will allow customers to know precisely the taxes to be paid and on what base.
    - GST will contribute and make additions to the government revenues by extending the tax base.
    - GST will provide input tax credits for the taxes paid by producers on the purchase of goods or services. It is supposed to inspire producers to buy raw material from GST registered persons and is expected to bring more and more vendors and suppliers under the purview of GST.
    - GST will remove the custom duties applicable to exports. India's competitiveness in overseas markets will increase on account of lesser costs of the transaction.
    
    ## A Brighter Economy
    
    The introduction of the Goods and Service Tax in India will be a very unusual step in the field of indirect tax reforms. By consolidating a number of Central and State taxes into a single tax, GST is expected to significantly mitigate double taxation and make taxation overall simple for the industries. For the end consumer, it will be most helpful in terms of the decline in the tax burden on goods as well as on services. GST will also make Indian products very competitive in the domestic and overseas markets. Last but not least, the administration of GST will be more comfortable due to its transparent character. After its implementation, the new taxation regime will hold great hope in terms of sustaining economic growth in India.
    
    GST is to be considered as a game-changer in indirect tax reform for the Indian economy by forming a common market and decreasing the impact of taxes on the cost of goods and services. GST is expected to affect the tax structure, computation of taxes, tax payments, compliances, availing and utilizing input tax credits. GST will have a high impact on almost all the aspects of business operations in the country, such as fixing the price for goods or services, supply chain optimization, and a better tax compliance system.
